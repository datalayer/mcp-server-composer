# Git-File Example - Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed

### 1. Configuration Structure
- ✅ Created `mcp_server_composer.toml` with nested `[[servers.proxied.stdio]]` structure
- ✅ Configured Git MCP server with repository path
- ✅ Configured Filesystem MCP server with /tmp access
- ✅ Set restart policy to "never" for development testing

### 2. Process Management
- ✅ Implemented `serve` command in CLI
- ✅ Integrated with ProcessManager for child process management
- ✅ Processes start successfully (Git and Filesystem servers)
- ✅ Clean shutdown on Ctrl+C
- ✅ Disabled auto-restart for development

### 3. Documentation & Tooling
- ✅ Created comprehensive README.md
- ✅ Created Makefile with install, start, agent commands
- ✅ Created agent.py demonstrating pydantic-ai integration pattern
- ✅ Added agent installation instructions

### 4. Agent Example
- ✅ Created `agent.py` based on mcp-auth example
- ✅ Removed authentication (anonymous access)
- ✅ Configured for SSE connection to http://localhost:8080/sse
- ✅ Added interactive CLI with example prompts

## 🚧 Work in Progress

### Unified MCP Server Endpoint

The `serve` command currently:
- ✅ Starts child MCP servers (git, filesystem) as STDIO processes
- ❌ Does not yet expose a unified MCP protocol endpoint

**What's needed:**
1. Integrate `MCPServerComposer` to create a unified server from child processes
2. Use `FastMCP` or existing `SSETransport` to expose SSE endpoint
3. Implement protocol translation:
   - Client → SSE → Composer → STDIO → Child servers
   - Child servers → STDIO → Composer → SSE → Client
4. Add tool name prefixing (git:log, filesystem:read_file)
5. Start HTTP server alongside process manager

**Architecture:**
```
┌─────────────┐
│   Client    │ (Agent, IDE, etc.)
└──────┬──────┘
       │ SSE (http://localhost:8080/sse)
       ↓
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│   MCP Server Composer (FastAPI) │
│   - Unified FastMCP server       │
│   - Tool aggregation & prefixing │
│   - Protocol translation         │
└──────┬───────────────────┬───────┘
       │ STDIO             │ STDIO
       ↓                   ↓
┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐
│ Git Server   │   │ File Server  │
│ (subprocess) │   │ (subprocess) │
└──────────────┘   └──────────────┘
```

## 📝 Current Behavior

### When you run `make start`:
1. ✅ ProcessManager starts
2. ✅ Git server starts as subprocess (PID assigned)
3. ✅ Filesystem server starts as subprocess (PID assigned)
4. ⚠️ Servers may exit immediately (STDIO servers expect client input)
5. ❌ No SSE endpoint is exposed
6. ❌ Agent cannot connect

### Strange Behavior - Calculator Opening
**Issue**: When running `uvx mcp-server-git` or `uvx mcp-server-filesystem`, a calculator app opens on desktop.

**Likely Cause**:
- `uvx` might be resolving to the wrong package
- System has a conflicting `mcp-server-*` command
- Package installation issue

**Solutions to try**:
1. Check what `uvx` resolves to: `which uvx`
2. Try direct python execution: `python -m mcp_server_git`
3. Use pip-installed commands directly
4. Check if `mcp-server-git` is properly installed: `pip list | grep mcp`

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix Child Server Launch
- [ ] Investigate calculator issue
- [ ] Test server commands manually: `uvx mcp-server-git --help`
- [ ] Consider alternative launch methods (pip-installed vs uvx)
- [ ] Ensure servers are the correct packages

### Priority 2: Implement Unified Endpoint
- [ ] Create `ComposerServer` class wrapping FastMCP
- [ ] Integrate with ProcessManager to connect to child STDIO processes
- [ ] Implement tool discovery from child servers
- [ ] Add tool name prefixing
- [ ] Expose SSE endpoint alongside process management
- [ ] Update `serve` command to start both processes and SSE server

### Priority 3: Testing
- [ ] Test agent.py connection once SSE endpoint is available
- [ ] Verify tool invocation through the unified endpoint
- [ ] Test multi-server tool name conflicts and prefixing
- [ ] Validate process management with real MCP traffic

## 📚 Reference Implementation

The mcp-auth example provides a working reference:
- `server.py`: FastMCP server with SSE transport
- `agent.py`: Pydantic-ai agent connecting via SSE
- Uses `mcp.sse_app()` to get ASGI app with /sse endpoint
- Wraps with authentication middleware

For composer, we need similar structure but:
- Multiple child servers instead of single FastMCP
- Protocol translation STDIO ↔ SSE
- Tool aggregation and conflict resolution
- Process lifecycle management
