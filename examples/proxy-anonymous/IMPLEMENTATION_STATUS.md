# Demo MCP Servers Example - Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed

### 1. Demo MCP Servers
- ✅ Created `mcp1.py` - Calculator server with math tools (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- ✅ Created `mcp2.py` - Echo server with string tools (ping, echo, reverse, uppercase, lowercase, count_words)
- ✅ Both servers use FastMCP for clean, simple implementation
- ✅ Both servers run via STDIO transport

### 2. Configuration Structure
- ✅ Created `mcp_server_composer.toml` with nested `[[servers.proxied.stdio]]` structure
- ✅ Configured Calculator server (python mcp1.py)
- ✅ Configured Echo server (python mcp2.py)
- ✅ Set restart policy to "never" for development testing

### 3. Process Management
- ✅ Implemented `serve` command in CLI
- ✅ Integrated with ProcessManager for child process management
- ✅ Both servers start successfully
- ✅ Clean shutdown on Ctrl+C
- ✅ Disabled auto-restart for development

### 4. Documentation & Tooling
- ✅ Updated README.md for demo servers
- ✅ Updated Makefile with correct dependencies
- ✅ Updated agent.py for Calculator and Echo servers
- ✅ Added clear examples and usage instructions

### 5. Agent Example
- ✅ Updated `agent.py` based on mcp-auth example
- ✅ Removed authentication (anonymous access)
- ✅ Configured for SSE connection to http://localhost:8080/sse
- ✅ Updated prompts for Calculator and Echo tools
- ✅ Added interactive CLI with example prompts

## 🚧 Work in Progress

### Unified MCP Server Endpoint

The `serve` command currently:
- ✅ Starts child MCP servers (git, filesystem) as STDIO processes
- ❌ Does not yet expose a unified MCP protocol endpoint

**What's needed:**
1. Integrate `MCPServerComposer` to create a unified server from child processes
2. Use `FastMCP` or existing `SSETransport` to expose SSE endpoint
3. Implement protocol translation:
   - Client → SSE → Composer → STDIO → Child servers
   - Child servers → STDIO → Composer → SSE → Client
4. Add tool name prefixing (git:log, filesystem:read_file)
5. Start HTTP server alongside process manager

**Architecture:**
```
┌─────────────┐
│   Client    │ (Agent, IDE, etc.)
└──────┬──────┘
       │ SSE (http://localhost:8080/sse)
       ↓
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│   MCP Server Composer (FastAPI) │
│   - Unified FastMCP server       │
│   - Tool aggregation & prefixing │
│   - Protocol translation         │
└──────┬───────────────────┬───────┘
       │ STDIO             │ STDIO
       ↓                   ↓
┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐
│ Git Server   │   │ File Server  │
│ (subprocess) │   │ (subprocess) │
└──────────────┘   └──────────────┘
```

## 📝 Current Behavior

### When you run `make start`:
1. ✅ ProcessManager starts
2. ✅ Calculator server starts as subprocess (PID assigned)
3. ✅ Echo server starts as subprocess (PID assigned)
4. ✅ Both servers run successfully
5. ⚠️ Servers may exit if no client connects (STDIO servers expect input)
6. ❌ No SSE endpoint is exposed yet
7. ❌ Agent cannot connect yet

### Issue: Calculator App Opening - SOLVED ✅
**Previous Issue**: The `mcp-server-filesystem` package from PyPI was fake and launched gnome-calculator.

**Solution**: Created custom Python MCP servers (mcp1.py, mcp2.py) with real tools:
- Calculator server: add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Echo server: ping, echo, reverse, uppercase, lowercase, count_words
- Both use FastMCP for proper MCP protocol implementation
- No external packages needed (except fastmcp)
- Clean, simple, and working correctly ✅

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix Child Server Launch
- [ ] Investigate calculator issue
- [ ] Test server commands manually: `uvx mcp-server-git --help`
- [ ] Consider alternative launch methods (pip-installed vs uvx)
- [ ] Ensure servers are the correct packages

### Priority 2: Implement Unified Endpoint
- [ ] Create `ComposerServer` class wrapping FastMCP
- [ ] Integrate with ProcessManager to connect to child STDIO processes
- [ ] Implement tool discovery from child servers
- [ ] Add tool name prefixing
- [ ] Expose SSE endpoint alongside process management
- [ ] Update `serve` command to start both processes and SSE server

### Priority 3: Testing
- [ ] Test agent.py connection once SSE endpoint is available
- [ ] Verify tool invocation through the unified endpoint
- [ ] Test multi-server tool name conflicts and prefixing
- [ ] Validate process management with real MCP traffic

## 📚 Reference Implementation

The mcp-auth example provides a working reference:
- `server.py`: FastMCP server with SSE transport
- `agent.py`: Pydantic-ai agent connecting via SSE
- Uses `mcp.sse_app()` to get ASGI app with /sse endpoint
- Wraps with authentication middleware

For composer, we need similar structure but:
- Multiple child servers instead of single FastMCP
- Protocol translation STDIO ↔ SSE
- Tool aggregation and conflict resolution
- Process lifecycle management
