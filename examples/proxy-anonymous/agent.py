"""
Pydantic AI Agent with MCP Server Composer

This agent demonstrates how to connect a pydantic-ai agent to the MCP Server Composer.
The composer manages multiple MCP servers and exposes them through a unified endpoint.

Features:
- Connection to MCP Server Composer via SSE transport
- Interactive CLI interface powered by pydantic-ai
- Access to Calculator and Echo server tools through the composer
- Uses Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 model

Usage:
    # First start the composer server:
    make start
    
    # Then in another terminal, run the agent:
    python agent.py

Learning Objectives:
1. Integrate pydantic-ai Agent with MCP Server Composer
2. Access multiple MCP servers through a unified interface
3. Build interactive CLI agents with pydantic-ai

Servers:
- Calculator Server (mcp1.py): add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Echo Server (mcp2.py): ping, echo, reverse, uppercase, lowercase, count_words

Tool names are prefixed with their server name to avoid conflicts.

When the user first connects, greet them and list all the available tools you have access to with a brief description of each.

When users ask you to perform calculations or string operations, use the appropriate tools.
