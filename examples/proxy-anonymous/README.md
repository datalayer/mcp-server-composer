# Demo MCP Servers Example

This example demonstrates how to use MCP Server Composer to manage multiple MCP servers from a configuration file.

## 🎯 Overview

This configuration launches two simple Python MCP servers managed by the composer:

1. **Calculator Server** (`mcp1.py`) - Math operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
2. **Echo Server** (`mcp2.py`) - String operations (ping, echo, reverse, uppercase, lowercase, count_words)

Both servers run in **proxy mode** via STDIO transport and are managed by the MCP Server Composer.

## 📋 Features

- **Two Simple Servers**: Calculator and Echo servers with basic tools
- **Pure Python**: No external dependencies beyond FastMCP
- **Configuration-Based**: Define servers in `mcp_server_composer.toml`
- **Process Management**: Composer manages server lifecycles
- **STDIO Transport**: Standard input/output for MCP communication
- **SSE API**: Unified MCP server endpoint for client connections (coming soon)
- **AI Agent Support**: Connect pydantic-ai agents to the composed server (coming soon)
- **Easy Management**: Simple make commands to control everything

## 🚀 Quick Start

> **⚠️ Note**: The serve command currently starts the child MCP servers but does not yet expose a unified SSE endpoint. The composer architecture is being implemented to provide a unified MCP protocol server that proxies requests to the child servers. For now, the example demonstrates configuration-based process management.

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
make install
```

This will install:
- `mcp-server-composer` (the orchestrator)
- `fastmcp` (for the demo MCP servers)

The example includes two simple Python MCP servers:
- `mcp1.py` - Calculator tools (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- `mcp2.py` - Echo tools (ping, echo, reverse, uppercase, lowercase, count_words)

### 2. Start the Composer

```bash
make start
```

The composer will:
- Read configuration from `mcp_server_composer.toml`
- Start both Calculator and Echo MCP servers as child processes
- Manage their lifecycles (coming soon: unified SSE endpoint)

### 3. Use the AI Agent (Coming Soon)

> **🚧 Work in Progress**: The agent integration requires the unified SSE endpoint to be implemented in the serve command. The agent.py file is ready and demonstrates the intended usage pattern.

```bash
# Install pydantic-ai
make install-agent

# Run the agent (requires SSE endpoint - coming soon!)
make agent
```

The agent is designed to:
- Connect to the MCP Server Composer via SSE
- Access tools from both Calculator and Echo servers through a unified interface
- Provide an interactive CLI powered by Anthropic Claude

Example interactions (once SSE endpoint is available):
- "What is 15 plus 27?"
- "Multiply 8 by 9"
- "Reverse the text 'hello world'"
- "Convert 'Hello World' to uppercase"
- "Count the words in 'The quick brown fox jumps'"

### 4. Stop the Composer

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the composer is running.

## � Features

- **Multiple Servers**: Git and Filesystem servers orchestrated together
- **Configuration-Based**: Define servers in `mcp_server_composer.toml`
- **Process Management**: Composer manages server lifecycles
- **STDIO Transport**: Standard input/output for MCP communication
- **Easy Management**: Simple make commands to control everything

## �🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
make install
```

This will install:
- `mcp-server-composer` (the orchestrator)
- `mcp-server-git` (Git operations)
- `mcp-server-filesystem` (File operations)

### 2. Start the Composer

```bash
make start
```

The composer will:
- Read configuration from `mcp_server_composer.toml`
- Start both Git and Filesystem MCP servers
- Manage their processes
- Handle auto-restart if servers crash

### 3. Stop the Composer

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the composer is running.

## 📊 Monitoring

### Prometheus Metrics

Metrics are exposed at: http://localhost:8000/metrics

Example metrics:
- `mcp_http_requests_total` - Total HTTP requests
- `mcp_tool_invocations_total` - Tool invocation count
- `mcp_request_duration_seconds` - Request latency

### Health Checks

```bash
# Simple health check
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health

# Detailed status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/status
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start

1. Check if port 8000 is available:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :8000
   ```

2. View logs:
   ```bash
   make logs
   ```

3. Check server status:
   ```bash
   make status
   ```

### Tools Not Found

1. Verify servers are running:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/servers
   ```

2. Restart servers:
   ```bash
   make restart
   ```

### Permission Errors (Filesystem)

The filesystem server is limited to `/tmp` by default. To access other directories, update the configuration:

```toml
args = ["mcp-server-filesystem", "/your/allowed/path"]
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

⚠️ **This example runs with NO AUTHENTICATION**

For production use:

1. **Enable authentication** in the config:
   ```toml
   [authentication]
   enabled = true
   providers = ["api_key"]
   
   [authentication.api_key]
   keys = ["your-secret-key"]
   ```

2. **Restrict filesystem access** to specific directories

3. **Use HTTPS** in production

4. **Enable CORS** only for trusted origins

5. **Add rate limiting** for public-facing deployments

See the [Security documentation](../../docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#security-hardening) for more details.
