## üéØ What's Working

### Configuration System
```toml
# mcp_server_composer.toml
[tool_manager]
conflict_resolution = "prefix"
versioning_enabled = true

[[tool_manager.overrides]]
pattern = "db_*"
strategy = "suffix"

[proxied.stdio.server1]
command = "python"
args = ["-m", "my_mcp_server"]
```

### Process Management
```python
async with ProcessManager() as manager:
    await manager.add_from_config(config)
    await manager.start_all()
    
    # Processes are managed automatically
    info = manager.list()
    print(f"Running: {len(info)} servers")
```

### Transport Layer
```python
# STDIO Transport
async with STDIOTransport("my-server", "python", ["-m", "server"]) as transport:
    await transport.send({"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "initialize", "id": 1})
    response = await transport.receive()
    
# SSE Transport (for web clients)
transport = create_sse_server("my-server", "localhost", 8000)
await transport.connect()
```

### Tool Management
```python
tool_manager = ToolManager(config)
tool_manager.register_tools("server1", ["read", "write", "execute"])
tool_manager.register_tools("server2", ["read", "execute"])  # Conflicts resolved!

# Access tools
tool = tool_manager.get_tool("server1_read")  # PREFIX strategy
versions = tool_manager.get_tool_versions("read")  # ["1.0", "2.0"]
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### Design Decisions
1. **Pydantic for Configuration** - Type safety and validation
2. **Asyncio Throughout** - Non-blocking I/O operations
3. **Transport Abstraction** - Easy to add WebSocket, gRPC, etc.
4. **Process-Based Proxying** - Standard subprocess for STDIO servers
5. **Wildcard Pattern Matching** - Flexible per-tool configuration

### Best Practices
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage on new modules
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages and logging
- ‚úÖ Context managers for resource management
- ‚úÖ Async/await for all I/O
- ‚úÖ Type hints throughout
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained

---

## üìù Technical Debt

### Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)
1. **SSE Cleanup** - Some async warnings during rapid disconnect
   - Priority: Medium
   - Impact: Low (functionality works)

2. **Composer Coverage** - 53% due to legacy paths
   - Priority: Low
   - Impact: None (new code well-tested)

### Future Enhancements
- Complete health monitoring metrics (CPU, memory)
- Resource limits enforcement
- Log aggregation system
- WebSocket transport implementation

## üéì Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
‚úÖ Incremental weekly milestones kept progress measurable  
‚úÖ Test-first approach caught issues early  
‚úÖ Clear architecture guidance from ARCHITECTURE.md

### Challenges Overcome
‚úÖ Async lifecycle management (task cancellation)  
‚úÖ SSE server graceful shutdown  
‚úÖ Complex tool conflict resolution logic  
‚úÖ Multi-process resource management
