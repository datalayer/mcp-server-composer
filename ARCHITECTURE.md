# Architecture

The MCP Server Composer is a Python facade for multiple `Managed MCP Servers`.

The MCP Servers exposes all the tools of the managed MCP Servers as a single MCP Servers, aggregating the tools.

A `Managed MCP Server`can be:

- `Embedded` based on a list of python packages located in a `mcp_server_composer.toml` file.
- `Proxied` which are external MCP Server accessible via `STDIO` and `Streamable HTTP`. The startup commands of those `Proxied` MCP Servers is located in the `mcp_server_composer.toml` file.

The supported exposed `transports` are the officiel MCP transports, namely `STDIO` and `Streamable HTTP`.

In terms of security:

- A configurable `Authn` (authentication) middleware is to be defined in `mcp_server_composer.toml`.
- A configurable `Authz` (authorization) middleware is to be defined in `mcp_server_composer.toml`.

The MCP Composer has some internal services:

- `Process Manager` responsible to start and monitor the Proxied MCP Servers
- `Tool Manager` responsible to resolved any naming conflict during the tool aggregation

The MCP Server Composer exposes its functionality via API (REST endpoints) and a UI (User Interface). The endpoints and UI are secured with the configurable `Authn` and `Authz`.
